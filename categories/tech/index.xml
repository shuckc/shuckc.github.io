We bought a chess book aimed for a young audiance to see the game taught gently, and I found myself learning more than expected.
Once down the rabbit hole of chess, I started to read about the early chess computers, and particularly those with bespoke hardware/software.</description></item><item><title>Bringing up ECP5 Versa with open tools on Windows</title><link>http://shucksmith.uk/posts/2021-06-14-fpga-versa-ecp5-board-demo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://shucksmith.uk/posts/2021-06-14-fpga-versa-ecp5-board-demo/</guid><description>Specifically the Lattice ECP5 FPGA Versa Dev Kit with part number LFE5UM-45F-VERSA-EVN which is ever so slightly different from the prjtrellis example versa5g design as it has a previous iteration of the FPGA.
I used a windows machine for this walkthrough, so most of this was setting up the host USB stack ready for OpenOCD.
FPGA Toolchain I used the YoWASP binary builds by Whitequark which are distributed as&amp;hellip; python packages and installed using pip.</description></item><item><title>Testing minio redis notifications</title><link>http://shucksmith.uk/posts/2020-03-17-minio-redis-notifications/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://shucksmith.uk/posts/2020-03-17-minio-redis-notifications/</guid><description>Documented at docs.min.io &amp;ldquo;Publish MinIO events via Redis&amp;rdquo;
